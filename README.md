Examples:
  # Create a new Rasa X deployment with an autogenerated name.
  $ rasactl start

  # Create a Rasa X deployment with custom configuration, e.g the following configuration changes a Rasa X version.
  # All available values: https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-x-helm/blob/main/charts/rasa-x/values.yaml
  $ rasactl start --values-file custom-configuration.yaml

  $ rasactl start --rasa-x-password mypassword

  # Create a Rasa X deployment that uses a local Rasa project.
  # The command is executed in a Rasa project directory.
  $ rasactl start --project

  # Create a Rasa X deployment with a defined name.
  $ rasactl start my-deployment

  # Create a new deployment if there is already one or more deployments.
  # rasactl start --create

Flags:
      --create                        create a new deployment. If --project or --project-path is set, or there is no existing deployment, the flag is not required to create a new deployment
  -h, --help                          help for start
  -p, --project                       use the current working directory as a project directory, the flag is ignored if --project-path is used
      --project-path string           absolute path to the project directory mounted in kind
      --rasa-x-chart-version string   a helm chart version to use

      --kubeconfig string   absolute path to the kubeconfig file (default "/Users/tczekajlo/.kube/config")
      --verbose             enable verbose output
```

### The `stop` command

The `stop` command stops a running Rasa X / Enterprise deployment.

### The `delete` command

The `delete` command deletes a Rasa X / Enterprise deployment.

You can use the `--prune` flag to remove a namespace where Rasa X deployment is located.

### The `list` command

List all deployments.

```text
$ rasactl list
CURRENT	NAME         	STATUS 	RASA PRODUCTION	RASA WORKER	ENTERPRISE	VERSION
       	hopeful-haibt	Running	2.8.1          	2.8.1      	inactive  	0.42.0
*      	vibrant-yalow	Running	2.8.1          	2.8.1      	inactive  	0.42.0
```

The `*` in the `CURRENT` field indicates a deployment that is used as default. It means that every time when you execute `rasactl` command without defining the deployment name, the deployment marked with `*` is used.

A deployment is marked as `CURRENT` if:

- there is a `.rasactl` file that includes a deployment name in your current working directory. The file is automatically created if you run the `rasactl start` command with the `--project` or `--project-path` flag
- there is only one deployment
- you set the current deployment by using the `rasactl config use-deployment` command

### The `status` command

Show the status of a deployment.

```text
$ rasactl status vibrant-yalow
Name:                   	vibrant-yalow
Status:                 	Running
URL:                    	http://vibrant-yalow.rasactl.localhost
Version:                	0.42.0
Enterprise:             	inactive
Rasa production version:	2.8.1
Rasa worker version:    	2.8.1
Project path:           	/home/ubuntu/test
```

### The `config use-deployment` command

Sets the current-deployment in the configuration file.

If you have multiple Rasa X deployments, and you are not in a project directory you have to explicitly define the deployment name during command execution.
You can define a deployment that is used as a current one by using the `rasa config use-deployment` command.

### The `connect rasa` command

The connect command connects a component to Rasa X / Enterprise, e.g. you can connect a local Rasa Server to a deployment.

```text
Connect Rasa OSS (Open Source Server) to Rasa X deployment.

The command prepares a configuration that's required to connect Rasa X deployment and run a local Rasa server.

It's required to have the 'rasa' command accessible by rasactl.

The command works only if Rasa X deployment uses a local rasa project.

Usage:
  rasactl connect rasa [DEPLOYMENT NAME] [flags]

Examples:
  # Connect Rasa Server to Rasa X deployment.
  $ rasactl connect rasa

  # Run a separate rasa server for the Rasa X worker environment.
  $ rasactl connect rasa --run-separate-worker

  # Pass extra arguments to rasa server.
  $ rasactl connect rasa --extra-args="--debug"

Flags:
      --extra-args strings    extra arguments for Rasa server
  -h, --help                  help for rasa
  -p, --port int              port to run the Rasa server at (default 5005)
      --run-separate-worker   runs a separate Rasa server for the worker environment

Global Flags:
      --config string       config file (default is $HOME/.rasactl.yaml)
      --debug               enable debug output
      --kubeconfig string   absolute path to the kubeconfig file (default "/Users/tczekajlo/.kube/config")
      --verbose             enable verbose output
```

### The `auth login` command

Log in to Rasa X / Enterprise. It stores credentials in an external credentials store, such as the native keychain of the operating system.

*  Apple macOS Keychain Access for macOS
*  pass for Linux
*  Microsoft Windows Credential Manager for Windows

***Notice*** For Linux, pass` is used as credential storage. `pass` must be installed and configured before you use the `rasactl auth` command. Below you can find an example of `pass` installation and configuration.

`pass` installation and configuration for Linux Ubuntu.

1. Install `pass`.

```text
sudo apt-get install pass
```

2. Generate a GPG key.

```text
$  gpg --gen-key
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.19; Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

gpg: directory '/home/ubuntu/.gnupg' created
gpg: keybox '/home/ubuntu/.gnupg/pubring.kbx' created
Note: Use "gpg --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation dialog.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: rasactl
Email address:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "rasactl"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
[...]
public and secret key created and signed.
```

3. Init `pass`.

```text
$ pass init rasactl
mkdir: created directory '/home/ubuntu/.password-store/'
Password store initialized for rasactl
```

Now you can use `rasactl auth` on Linux.

```text
$ rasactl ls
CURRENT	NAME             	STATUS 	RASA PRODUCTION	RASA WORKER	ENTERPRISE	VERSION
       	wonderful-gagarin	Running	2.8.1          	2.8.1      	inactive  	0.42.0
$ rasactl auth login wonderful-gagarin
Username: me
Password:
Successfully logged.
```

***Troubleshooting*** If you see `Error: exit status 2: gpg: decryption failed: No secret key` error you should export the following environment variable `export GPG_TTY="$(tty)"`.

### The `auth logout` command

Removes access credentials for an account.

### Run Rasa X / Enterprise with a local Rasa Server

It is possible to run a Rasa X / Enterprise deployment with a local rasa server. The following example shows how to connect a local rasa server that is installed in a Python environment to a running Rasa X / Enterprise deployment.

1. Install `rasa` on your local machine. More information on how to install `rasa` you can find in the [docs](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/).
2. Activate a Python environment with installed `rasa` (this step is optional if you don't use a Python environment).

```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ rasa --version
Rasa Version      :         2.7.0
Minimum Compatible Version: 2.6.0
Rasa SDK Version  :         2.8.1
Rasa X Version    :         None
Python Version    :         3.7.11
Operating System  :         Darwin-20.5.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python Path       :         /repos/rasa/.venv/bin/python3.7
```

3. Connect a local rasa server to a Rasa X / Enterprise deployment.

```bash
$ rasactl connect rasa funny-hopper
●∙∙ Starting Rasa Server
(production-worker) 2021-08-09 15:56:45 INFO     root  - Starting Rasa server on http://localhost:5005

```

4. You can check the status of your deployment and see that Rasa version is the same as the rasa version installed locally.

```bash
$ rasactl status funny-hopper
Name:                   	funny-hopper
Status:                 	Running
URL:                    	http://funny-hopper.rasactl.localhost
Version:                	0.42.0
Enterprise:             	inactive
Rasa production version:	2.7.0
Rasa worker version:    	2.7.0
Project path:           	not defined
```

### Run Rasa X / Enterprise with mounted a local Rasa project

The example shows how to run Rasa X / Enterprise deployment with mounted a local rasa project.

1. Install `rasa` on your local machine. More information on how to install `rasa` you can find in the [docs](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/).
2. Create a rasa project

```bash
$ rasa init
```

3. Start a new Rasa X / Enterprise deployment.

```bash
$ sudo rasactl start --project
```

(The `rasa start --project` command has to be executed in a directory with rasa project. You can use the `--project-path` flag to pass an absolute path to a rasa project.)

4. Open Rasa X / Enterprise in a web browser.

```bash
$ rasactl open
```

### Upgrade Rasa X / Enterprise version

The following example shows how to upgrade Rasa X / Enterprise version for a deployment that already exists.

1. Create the `values.yaml` file with a specific version.

```yaml
# values.yaml
rasax:
  tag: "0.42.0"
eventService:
  tag: "0.42.0"
dbMigrationService:
  tag: "0.42.0"
```

2. Run upgrade.

```bash
$ rasactl upgrade deployment-name --values-file values.yaml
```

### Deploy Rasa X in one of the public cloud providers

The following example shows how to deploy Rasa X in one of the major cloud providers. In the example, GCP (Google Cloud Platform) is used.

1. Create a VM using a Linux base image. You can find detailed information on how to create a VM [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance).
2. [Install rasactl](#installation) on the VM
3. Start a new deployment by executing the `rasactl start` command.
4. After several minutes you should see details of your deployment.

```text
$ rasactl start
∙∙∙ Ready!

╭ Rasa X ────────────────────────────────╮
│                                        │
│    URL: http://35.184.183.164:30012    │
│    Rasa X version: 0.42.0              │
│    Rasa X password: rasaxlocal         │
│                                        │
╰────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

***Important!*** The Rasa X / Enterprise deployment will be exposed to the public on one of the service node ports (`30000-30100`). Remember to add a rule to firewall configuration that allows for access to the Rasa X deployment.

### Upload a model to Rasa X

The following example shows how to download an existing model and upload it via `rasactl`.

1. Download a model.

```text
$ curl -L https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-x-demo/blob/master/models/model.tar.gz?raw=true --output model.tar.gz
[...]
```

2. Upload the download model to Rasa X.

```text
$ rasactl model upload [deployment name] model.tar.gz

Successfully uploaded.
```

You can use the `rasa model list` command to list all available models, e.g

```text
$ rasactl model list [deployment name]
NAME 	VERSION	COMPATIBLE	TAGS	HASH                            	TRAINED AT
model	2.8.2  	true      	none	093dfaad610d330e5f36e6d7dc104d86	05 Aug 21 13:16 UTC
```

## Development

ToDO: this section will be rewrite. It's waiting for `Makefile`.

Below you can find a setup required for developing `rasactl` locally.

### How to run it?

1. Install go

```
$ brew install go
```

2. Compile it

```
$ go build
```

3. Run it

```
$ ./rasactl
```

4. (optional) Make rasactl global

```
$ sudo cp rasactl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Kind cluster for developing purposes

1. Install kind and run it

```
brew install kind
```

2. Prepare configuration for a kind cluster

```
$ bash kind/generate-config.sh > config.yaml
```

3. Create a kind cluster

```
$ kind create cluster --config config.yaml
```

After kind is ready, install ingress-nginx:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
$ kubectl delete -A ValidatingWebhookConfiguration ingress-nginx-admission
```

### Deploy Rasa X with mounted a local path

1. Go to a rasa project directory

2. Deploy Rasa X

```
$ sudo ./rasactl start -p
```

### Open Rasa X in a web browser

```
$ ./rasactl open
```

### Deploy Rasa X with mounted a local path and a custom Docker image

1. Create a namespace

```
$ kubectl create ns my-test
```

2. Generate a token

```
$ gcloud auth print-access-token
```

3. Create a secret
```
$ kubectl -n my-test create secret docker-registry gcr --docker-server=eu.gcr.io --docker-username=oauth2accesstoken --docker-password=<token>
```

4. Patch the default service account

```
$ kubectl -n my-test patch serviceaccount default -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "gcr"}]}'
```

***Notice*** Token is valid for only one hour, after that time you have to delete the `gcr` secret (`kubectl -n my-test delete secret gcr`) and repeat the 2 and 3 steps.

4. Create a deployment with a custom Docker image

```
$ ./rasactl start my-test -p --values-file testdata/test-image.yaml
```
