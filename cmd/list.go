The '*' in the 'CURRENT' field indicates a deployment that is used as default.
It means that every time when you execute 'rasactl' commandwithout defining
the deployment name, the deployment marked with '*' is used.

A deployment is marked as 'CURRENT' if in a current working directory is located
the '.rasactl' file that includes a deployment name. The file is automatically created
if you run the 'rasactl start' command with the '--project' or '--project-path' flag.
